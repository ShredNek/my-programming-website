        <p>
          I am a passionate, dedicated, and zealous web designer. I specialise
          in UX/UI design and working with front-end frameworks, such as React,
          TypeScript, Scss, and many other tools.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am no stranger to back-end projects either, as I have complete
          numerous projects involving the processing of data from controllers
          and then performing CRUD operations, for example.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As of {getCurrYear()}, I have had {getCurrExperience()} years of
          experience as a developer. Please see my portfolio below to view all
          of my work.
